cgi-scripts
===========

Drop and configure CGI Scripts.

The intent is to provide a set of easy to use and configure cgi scripts that
are useful for small websites.

environment.cgi
---------------

This script is intended for web masters who are initially setting up a
web site. It displays the environment variables that are available to a
script. It should be installed on the new site and then deleted after
it is run.

search.cgi
----------

This search engine is intended for web masters with small static sites
(up to 1000 pages) under a single directory tree. It is installed as a
cgi script, so your ISP must allow you to install your own cgi scripts
in order to use it. See the documenation at the top of the file for more
information on installing an configuring the script.
